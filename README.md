**The Book of Answers: Gesture Edition**

This is a small, experimental web project that presents a virtual “book of answers” you can interact with using hand gestures and a webcam. It is meant purely for fun and exploration. The idea came from watching *The Book of Answers* being used on the show 向往的生活, and I built this as a digital version when I did not have a physical copy.

**How it works**

The site uses MediaPipe Hands to detect simple hand gestures in real time. An open palm opens the book and shuffles answers. A fist reveals the chosen answer. Holding a fist for three seconds closes the book and returns to the cover. Everything runs locally in the browser. No data is collected or stored.
